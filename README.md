- Node.js 20 or higher
- WordPress site with REST API enabled
- WordPress Application Password (see setup below)

## Installation

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your WordPress credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## WordPress Application Password Setup

1. Log in to your WordPress admin dashboard
2. Go to **Users** → **Profile** (or **Users** → **All Users** → select your user)
3. Scroll down to **Application Passwords** section
4. Enter a name (e.g., "Bulk Uploader") and click **Add New Application Password**
5. Copy the generated password (it will look like: `xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx`)
6. Paste it into your `.env` file as `WP_APP_PASSWORD`

**Important:** The application password is shown only once. Save it immediately.

## Configuration

Edit your `.env` file:

```env
# WordPress Site Configuration
WP_SITE=https://your-site.com          # Your WordPress site URL (no trailing slash)
WP_USER=your_username                  # Your WordPress username
WP_APP_PASSWORD=xxxx xxxx xxxx...      # Application password from WordPress

# CSV Configuration
CSV_PATH=posts.csv                     # Path to your CSV file
DEFAULT_STATUS=draft                   # Default status for posts (draft|publish|private|pending)
REQUEST_DELAY_MS=300                   # Delay between requests in milliseconds

# Server Configuration
PORT=3000                              # Port for web interface (default: 3000)

# Web Interface Authentication (REQUIRED for security)
AUTH_USERNAME=admin                    # Username for web interface login
AUTH_PASSWORD=change-this-to-secure    # Password for web interface login (use strong password!)
```

**Important Security Note:** 
- **Always set `AUTH_USERNAME` and `AUTH_PASSWORD`** in your `.env` file to protect the web interface
- Use strong passwords to prevent unauthorized access
- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Default credentials (admin/admin123) are only used if not set, and a warning will be displayed

## Usage

### Web Interface (Recommended for Non-Technical Users)

1. Start the web server:

```bash
npm run server
# or
npm start
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:3000`
3. Click "Choose CSV File" and select your CSV file
4. Click "Upload & Process"
5. View results in the browser

### Command-Line Interface

1. Prepare your CSV file (see format above)
2. Run the uploader:

```bash
npm run upload
```

The script will prompt you for the CSV file path, or you can provide it as an argument:

```bash
npm run upload "C:\path\to\your\file.csv"
```

The script will:
1. Check WordPress REST API connectivity
2. Load and parse your CSV file
3. Process each row (create/update posts, upload images, create terms)
4. Display progress in the console
5. Generate `import_log.json` with detailed results

## Output

### Console Output

```

## Troubleshooting

### 401 Unauthorized

**Problem:** Authentication failed

**Solutions:**
- Verify `WP_USER` matches your WordPress username exactly
- Check that `WP_APP_PASSWORD` is correct (no extra spaces)
- Ensure you're using an Application Password, not your regular WordPress password
- Make sure the Application Password hasn't been revoked in WordPress

### 403 Forbidden (REST API Blocked)

**Problem:** WordPress REST API is disabled or blocked

**Solutions:**
- Check if REST API is enabled in WordPress (it should be by default)
- Disable security plugins temporarily to test
- Check `.htaccess` or server configuration for REST API blocks
- Verify your WordPress version supports REST API (WordPress 4.7+)

### Media Upload Errors

**Problem:** Featured images fail to upload

**Solutions:**
- Verify the file path in `featured_image_path` is correct (relative to script directory)
- Check file permissions (script must be able to read the image file)
- Ensure the file format is supported by WordPress (jpg, png, gif, etc.)
- Check WordPress media upload limits (file size, dimensions)
- Verify your user has permission to upload media

### Rate Limits / Timeouts

**Problem:** Requests are being throttled or timing out

**Solutions:**
- Increase `REQUEST_DELAY_MS` in `.env` (try 500, 1000, or higher)
- Check if your hosting provider has rate limits
- Verify WordPress security plugins aren't blocking requests
- Check network connectivity and WordPress site performance

### Connection Errors

**Problem:** Cannot reach WordPress site

**Solutions:**
- Verify `WP_SITE` URL is correct (no trailing slash, include `https://`)
- Check if the site is accessible from your network
- Verify SSL certificate is valid (if using HTTPS)
- Check firewall or VPN settings

### CSV Parsing Errors

**Problem:** CSV file not loading correctly

**Solutions:**
- Ensure CSV is UTF-8 encoded
- Check that required columns (`title`, `content`) are present
- Verify CSV format (proper commas, quoted strings if containing commas)
- Check file path in `CSV_PATH` is correct

## How It Works

### Idempotency

If a `slug` is provided in the CSV:
- The script searches for an existing post with that slug
- If found → updates the existing post
- If not found → creates a new post

If no `slug` is provided:
- Always creates a new post

### Term Resolution

For categories and tags:
1. Search for existing term by name
2. If found → use existing term ID
3. If not found → create new term and use new ID

### Rate Limiting

The script waits `REQUEST_DELAY_MS` milliseconds between write operations (create/update posts, create terms, upload media) to avoid overwhelming the server or triggering rate limits.

## Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Application Passwords can be revoked in WordPress at any time
- The script uses Basic Authentication over HTTPS (ensure your site uses SSL)
- Passwords are never printed in logs or console output
